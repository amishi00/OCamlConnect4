# Connect4 in OCaml
## What it is
Our project is an interactive game of Connect 4, written in OCaml. It supports standard operations 
  such as players adding their individual tokens represented by 'R' for the red player and 
  'B' for the blue player. In our terminal interface, the game signals a win if one 
  player gets 4 of their tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally 
  or a draw if every column and row is full. With various player modes (as selected
  by the user), statistics of the game rounds presented, and player score tracking, 
  Connect 4 All is taken to a new level with a more engaging and creative user interface. It also uses the minimax algorithm AI to provide the best move for the player in easy mode. 
  The user can choose to play any of the following 4 modes:
1. Easy Mode vs Computer
 2.  Medium Mode vs Computer
 3.  Hard Mode vs Computer
 4.  Multiplayer Mode

  ## How to Play
You can play the game using the following instructions:
1. To build the program, run 'dune build' in the terminal
2. To execute the program, run 'dune exec bin/main.exe' in the terminal
3. Have fun playing the game! Follow the instructions in the terminal to play.

## Collaboration/Feedback
We are always looking for ways to improve the algorithm and the user experience. If you would like to contribute or provide feedback, please reach out to me at amishigupta2809@gmail.com!
